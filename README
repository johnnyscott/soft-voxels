short term GOALS 
-Camera
    * horizontal rotation range 360(?)
    * strafe
    * html console    
    * toggle fly mode
    
-World
    * lighting
        o learn shader
        o find limits on count
    * skybox
    * figure out wireframe toggle
    * try no double sided (backface cull)
    * find performance limits
    * find fastest environment (browser, outside of browser?!)
    * single geometry push - how to?
    * single texture push - how to?
    
Architecture
    * learn about scene graphs
    * change field to a scene graph
   
    
    * (maybe too much to ask right now?) import a model from max including coords + texture
    
    
big picture GOALS

Character
    * get dummy character with mario 64 movement controls 
    * add jump to character
    * basic physics in movement (direction vector, friction again)

Camera
    * over the shoulder view 3rd person
    * camera on a track view (accelerate/ decelerate)
        o draw paths, represent them
        o stopping points? CLICKS on path?
    * swap views ->world view (default) -> and back
